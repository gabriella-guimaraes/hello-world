# hello-world
My first repository
Hello there! My name is Gabriella and I'm starting to learn how to code.
Programing always amazed me and I'm so excited to start to learn about it. 
Hm... I don't know what else I could say, so here is some funny facts about me
1- Star Wars is my favorite franchise.
2- I love conspiracy theories, video games and drawing.
3- Vincent van Gogh is my all time favorite artist.
